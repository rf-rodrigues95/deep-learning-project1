# Deep Learning Project: Pokémon Image Classification  
**NOVA University of Lisbon – 2024/2025**  

---

## Overview

This repository contains the code and final report for a Deep Learning project focused on classifying Pokémon images by their primary type (e.g., Water, Fire, Grass). The project is structured into three tasks, each building upon the previous one with increasingly advanced image classification techniques:

1. **Task 1: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classification**  
2. **Task 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Development**  
3. **Task 3: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning**
