## Overview

This repository contains the code and final report for a Deep Learning project focused on classifying Pokémon images by their primary type (e.g., Water, Fire, Grass). The project is structured into three tasks, each building upon the previous one with increasingly advanced image classification techniques:

1. **Task 1: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classification**  
2. **Task 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Development**  
3. **Task 3: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning**

## Repository Structure

- /Task1/ # Jupyter notebooks and source code for MLP classification
- /Task2/ # Jupyter notebooks and source code for CNN development
- /Task3/ # Jupyter notebooks and source code for transfer learning and fine-tuning
- /report/ # Final comprehensive report covering all tasks (PDF)


Each task folder includes all related code and experiments for that stage. The `/report/` folder contains the final report summarizing methodology, results, and insights from all tasks.

## Project Description

Resource optimization strategies such as early stopping, batch size tuning, and checkpointing were applied.

### Task 1: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classification
- Data exploration and handling class imbalance  
- MLP architecture design and training  
- Performance evaluation

### Task 2: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Development
- CNN model design tailored to Pokémon images  
- Training with techniques to reduce overfitting and class imbalance  
- Performance comparison with MLP

### Task 3: Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning
- Use of pre-trained models (ResNet)  
- Fine-tuning with data augmentation and regularization  
- Final performance evaluation and analysis
